# TPH-vs-PAH-relationshib-Gulf-of-Mexico
Linear relationship of Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)  and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)

This is part of the project in Gulf of Mexico to see how Total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH)  and Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are related to each other after DWH oil spill.

# Conclusion

Our data show high corelation between TPH and PAh concentration after DWH oil spill.  Our  Adjusted R-squared:  0.8756  and  p-value: < 2.2e-16 that show strong relationshib between these two variables.
